full factorial experiment: 
each factor is tested independently
each factor is tested at each level in every possible combination with the other factors and their levels

The F-test analysis (F-ratio): 
ratio of the variation between groups (a group varies from another by a factor) and within groups

Factors may generate non-linear effects that are not additive
