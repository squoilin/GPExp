% dataset_pump_orcnext
% 
% First experimental campaign on the ORCNext setup by Nicolas Melotte
% The pump consumption was measured with a clamp meter, which later turned
% out to be very inaccurate in the low power range, leading to a very poor
% dataset.
% The flow rate was measured by a coriolis flow meter, which should be more
% accurate
